              To achieve this, I undertook the following steps:
            </h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Utilized linear algebra to compute the page rank of a simulated
                internet, exploring vectors and matrices extensively. This
                included tackling the intricate concepts of eigenvalues and
                eigenvectors to address various problems. Additionally, I
                applied these principles to manipulate datasets creatively, such
                as rotating images of faces and analyzing eigenvectors to gain
                insights into the PageRank algorithm.
              </li>
              <li>
                Employed multivariate calculus to construct and train a neural
                network from scratch, facilitating a deeper understanding of its
                functioning and training process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conducted a non-linear least squares regression to effectively
                model a dataset, showcasing the application of mathematical
                optimization techniques in fitting complex models to empirical
                data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Explored the geometric properties of vectors by computing
                distances, and angles, and performing orthogonal projections
                onto lower-dimensional subspaces using inner products.
              </li>
              <li>
                Subsequently, I derived Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
                minimize the average squared reconstruction error between data
                points and their projections, thereby revealing underlying
                patterns and reducing data dimensionality effectively.
